    <center><h2><font color="#c11407"> History of the US National Parks</font></h2></center>

 <p>To date, there are 59 awe inspiring national parks in the United States of America  and they are all governed by the National Park Service (NPS).  The NPS is an agency reporting to the Department of the Interior and was the byproduct of the Organic Act of 1916 enacted by Congress.</p>
<p>Coined “America’s Greatest Idea,” National Parks are heralded to be one of America’s most significant accomplishments, and they certainly are.  However, prior to the formation of the NPS, the national parks shockingly, didn’t have a “proper home” in the United States government.    The US government was not, at the time, effective in identifying an appropriate agency to govern its newly found treasures.    At various times the National Parks were inconsistently and counter-intuitively assigned to the Department of War.  Then, the parks were “more appropriately” overseen by Department of Agriculture and later the Department of the Interior.   Congress, wisely enacted, in 1916, the Organic Act and thus the NPS was given birth to deal with the specific needs of the National Parks of the US.</p> 
<p>Yellowstone, spanning Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, was the first park to be given the title of National Park in 1872 and now, some 140 years later the National Parks comprise over 400 areas, covering over 84 million acres of untouched terrain across the United States.  In addition to being breathtakingly beautiful, national parks are the most biologically valuable topography in the US bestowing them the time honored status of “protected areas.”</p>  
<p>American history is riddled with paradoxes, and the history of the National Park is not immune to this.  In the end, the US government got it right.   As breathtakingly beautiful, the US national parks are, the history preceding it is ironically filled with horror.   George Catlin (July 26, 1796 – December 23, 1872) an American painter, in 1832 documented the genocide of Native Americans through his art form.  He travelled a total of 5 times out West and painted portraits of the Great Plain Native American leaders as well as their tribe’s daily activities.</p>
<p>Witnessing first hand, the senseless slaughter of wildlife and shameless killing of Native Americans, Catlin became the first preservation advocate.  As an advocate for the preservation of nature, Catlin fought for government policy to preserve land “where man and beast could reside in nature’s beauty” as Caitlin so eloquently put it.   Caitlin’s approach in documenting the savagery against the Native Americans, was by the means of non-violent communication using paintbrushes to canvas.</p>
<p>Despite their flaws, Theodore Roosevelt,   Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson were presidents who later became very influential in advocating the preservation of the National Parks and in the movement towards conservationism.   In the end these men did the right thing for the greater good. </p>
